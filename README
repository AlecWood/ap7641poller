Super-duper straightforward poller for the APC AP7641 series of rack PDUs.

I had some issues getting mine to expose any useful data via ethernet without buying expensive software from APC, so I scribbled this tool to observe the current output via the RS232 port. It is very simple and quite brittle - it works fine for me but it might not for you.

You'll need a cable, too. The RJ12 at the PDU can be wired to a DB9 like this:

APC						PC

pin 1		NC		X
pin 2		GND		pin 5
pin 3		rx		pin 2
pin 4		tx		pin 3
pin 5		NC		X
pin 6		NC		X
